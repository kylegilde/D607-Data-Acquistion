## learning more about stringr

Where do we go to get more information about an R package?

Sometimes, the newest (or only) version of a package may not yet be on CRAN.  You can use the devtools package to pull from (for example) GitHub, if you trust the package source.

```{r eval=FALSE}

vignette(package="stringr")

browseVignettes(package="stringr")

data(package="stringr")   # fruit, sentences, words
```

See also the documentation at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/stringr.pdf

## is the letter k more likely to appear as the first letter or the third letter in common words?

Concept: anchors

```{r}
str_subset(words, "k")

```


![](https://github.com/maddogdatascience/msda/blob/master/MisshulaQuote.png?raw=true)


```{r}
str_subset(words, "^k")
str_subset(words, "^..k")
```

## In the English language, are fruit names more likely to have repeated pairs of characters than common words overall?

Concepts: groups, backreferences

```{r}
str_view(fruit, "(..)\\1", match=TRUE)
str_view(words, "(..)\\1", match=TRUE)

str_detect(fruit, "(..)\\1")

mean(str_detect(fruit, "(..)\\1"))
mean(str_detect(words, "(..)\\1"))
```

Looking at sentences

```{r}
str_view(sentences, "(..)\\1", match=TRUE)
str_view(sentences, "([[:alpha:]][[:alpha:]])\\1", match=TRUE)
```
